# Cloning the repo
Before you start, make sure you have Git setup on your machine. You can download it [**here**](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.47.0.windows.2/Git-2.47.0.2-64-bit.exe).
<br>Or, you can make use of the GUI tools available, like:
- Git Fork
- GitHub Desktop

## Steps
1. Open the repository on [**GitHub.com**](https://github.com/SCJWT7E_deere/theamazingstore) or on [**GitHub.deere.com**]()
2. Click on "Use this template" button ![use-this-template](./use-this-template.png)
3. Create a new repository from the template. It must be created in your GitHub account (do not use any John Deere organization) and add a creative name to it! ![create-repo](./creating-from-template.png)
4. Click on "Code" to clone your newly created repository (NOT THE TEMPLATE!!!) to your local machine ![clone-the-repo](./cloning-the-repo.png)
   - Example using CLI: ```git clone https://github.com/SCJWT7E_deere/teste-bruno.git```
5. Open the project in your favorite IDE and start working on the solutions to make the tests pass! ðŸš€

## Cloning from GitHub Desktop
**If you already created the repo from the template, it'll appear on the repositories list for your account**:

![step-2-cloning-github-desktop](./githubdesktop-2.png)
Remember the folder you used to clone the repository, as you'll need it to open the project in your IDE.

## Cloning from CLI
1. **AFTER YOU INSTALLED GIT ON YOUR MACHINE**, open your terminal (cmd/git bash/powershell)
2. Copy the url from [Step 4](#steps), type ``git clone ``and paste it in the terminal !<br>```git clone https://github.com/<your-user-id>/<repo-name>.git``` ![cli-1](./cloning-from-cli-1.png)
3. Hit enter and wait for the repository to be cloned to your machine! **Remember the folder you ran git clone, you'll need it to commit you changes**
4. Open the project in your favorite IDE and start working on the solutions to make the tests pass! ðŸš€
### P.S.: A window may appear to config the clone if you clone using HTTPS. Just hit enter to proceed.
