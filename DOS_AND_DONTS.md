# Dos and Don'ts ⚠️

## Dos
- ✅ Implement the methods to make the unit tests pass
- ✅ Create your own classes or private methods for your solution, if you think it is necessary
- ✅ Change the existing methods signature if you think it is necessary
- ✅ Make the unit tests pass

## Don'ts
- ❌ Change the unit tests validations
- ❌ Add external dependencies - you can use only the ones that are already in the project
- ❌ Use AI to solve the problems - we want to see your code and how you think
- ❌ **Copy and paste** solutions from the internet - although the internet is a great source of knowledge and we're not preventing any use of it, we want to see your solution
- ❌ Copy or send the code to someone else - this is a **personal** challenge. Be **ethical** and **honest** with your work,
